### Problem we are trying to solve?

Due to Covid-19, remote learning has been a constant and so have online examinations.  
But proctoring has always been a task and cheating and unfair practices have always been a problem.

**Problems with the existing system:**

The current solutions assume the presence of two platforms:  
- One for writing exams (like Google Forms)  
- And another (like Meet or Zoom) for manual proctoring

**MonitorPal** aims to replace the need for human invigilation by automatically monitoring student behavior during the test â€” no teacher needed.

### Market & User Research

- Existing tools are largely paid.
- Students find the UX of such platforms clunky.
- Educators often need to manually upload or format tests.
- No real-time admin dashboard or control panel is available.

Thatâ€™s where **MonitorPal** steps in.  
A smart, intuitive, and unified platform.

## Architecture and Design

Hackathon tradeoff: `Speed over quality`  
But weâ€™re proud to say we kept structure and best practices in mind:

- Architecture
- Design
- Code
